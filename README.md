# Utility DB MSSQL
 
## Summary
These are the useful SQL Server shortcuts & logging methods.\
Links within each for the source of the method. Mostly [mssqltips](https://www.mssqltips.com/) or [sqlshack](https://www.sqlshack.com/).\
These are from the perspective of Non-DBA potentially not having full server access.\
So there are better permission & built in solutions for some like DDL Protect & CDC.
